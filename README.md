# Shop-Managment-System-Using-Java-Database-Connectivity

A Shop Management System is a software application that helps manage the day-to-day operations of a retail store. It can be used to keep track of inventory, sales, customer information, and more.

JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is a Java API that allows you to connect to a database and perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations. Here are the steps to set up a simple CRUD operation using JDBC:

Connect to the database: Load the JDBC driver and create a connection object.
Create a new record: Use the connection object to create a new record in the database using an SQL INSERT statement.
Read a record: Use an SQL SELECT statement and execute it using the connection object to read a record from the database.
Update a record: Use an SQL UPDATE statement and execute it using the connection object to update a record in the database.
Delete a record: Use an SQL DELETE statement and execute it using the connection object to delete a record from the database.
